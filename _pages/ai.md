# AI-First at Work: How We’re Embedding AI into Everyday Operations  
*By Robert Liotta*

---

## 🚀 AI-First Isn’t a Buzzword — It’s a Daily Practice

Last Tuesday, a developer saved 3 hours by using AI to write API docs — and that’s just one example.  
At CEVA, these moments aren’t edge cases. They’re becoming **the norm**.

“AI-first” is more than a strategy — it’s a **daily operational mindset**. We’ve moved past the hype and into execution: from meetings and pipelines to goal-setting and decision-making.

We’re not waiting for perfect tools. We’re asking better questions. The one we ask weekly?

> 💬 _“What did you rethink with AI this week?”_

It’s a simple line. But it changes how teams show up.

## 🔍 What AI *Is* — and What It’s Not

Let’s clear the fog.

### 🧠 Weak AI vs. Strong AI

- **Weak AI** (everything we use today): Trained for specific tasks like summarization, classification, or prediction. It doesn’t think. It mimics.
- **Strong AI** (sci-fi for now): Hypothetical general intelligence that might reason or feel. It doesn’t exist — and shouldn’t distract us.

💡 **Bottom line**: Today’s AI is a **power tool**, not a replacement.

---

## ❗ Why AI Shouldn’t Scare You

Yes, AI will change jobs. But it **won’t eliminate the need for people** — it eliminates the busywork that burns them out:

- Rewriting the same update five times
- Manually formatting decks
- Digging through a messy inbox

> ⚠️ The real threat isn’t AI taking your job.  
> It’s someone **with AI** doing it better, faster, and smarter.

## 🧰 What’s Driving Our AI Culture

We didn’t wait for a top-down rollout. We **embedded lightweight cultural triggers** that scale:

| 🔄 Practice | 💡 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| **Weekly AI Reflection** | “What did you rethink with AI?” – sparks mindset shift |
| **Small Wins Showcase** | 5-minute demos at all-hands or team calls |
| **Leadership Modeling** | Leaders share *how* they use AI, not just *that* they do |
| **Prompt Libraries** | Internal guides for using AI across roles |
| **Safe Space to Fail** | It's okay to try, iterate, and improve — not everything needs to be perfect |

## 📍 Real AI-First Moments at CEVA

Here’s where the theory becomes real.

---

### 🎓 1. AI Training & Leadership Readiness

- Managers across France participated in **Tangram AI training**, including 12+ hours of pre-work and a 5-day hands-on workshop.

- Focus: real skills, not academic lectures.

### 💻 2. AI in Development & Automation

- Used AI for **code analysis**, **impact assessments**, and **automated documentation**.
- Moving toward **automation-first development pipelines**.

### 🔄 4. AI in Daily Operations

- AI helps us:  
  - Create ServiceNow tickets from emails  
  - Summarize threads  
  - Generate executive PowerPoints

### 💰 5. AI-Powered FinOps

- AI analyzes Kubernetes usage and cost patterns.
- Enables **chargebacks** and smarter cost controls per app.

---

### 🔬 6. Decision Support & Research

- Used AI to evaluate architecture trade-offs (e.g., canonical vs unstructured models).
- Synthesized scattered info (social media, PDFs, websites) for strategy decks.

## 🎯 Final Thought: Don’t Just “Adopt” AI — **Embed It**

At CEVA, we’re not just exploring AI. We’re **operationalizing it**.

> It’s helping us write faster, think deeper, and build more — with less friction.

And most importantly, it’s freeing people to do what only people can:  
**Build relationships. Drive strategy. Make decisions. Spark growth.**

This isn’t about humans vs AI.  
It’s about **humans amplified by AI**.

## 👋 Want to Start?

Next time you’re in a team meeting, try this one-liner:

> **“What did you rethink with AI this week?”**

That’s where the mindset shift begins.
